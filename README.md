# Differentially-private-tree-based-redescription-mining
This repository contains the code of 3 different tree-based differentially private algorithms.

This code was created by Matej Mihelčić for the manuscript: "Differentially Private Tree-Based Redescription Mining" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06630) created in collaboration with prof. Pauli Miettinen, University of Eastern Finland. 

This code builds upon the source code provided with the manuscript: 
"Embedding differential privacy in decision tree algorithm with different depths" by authors Xuanyu BAI , Jianguo YAO*, Mingxuan YUAN, Ke DENG, Xike Xie and Haibing Guan.
